# rheology

## Description:
In the DeForest lab, we are making user-tunable, injectable hydrogels. The tunability of these gels can be assessed by rheology. Unfortunately, the user interface for our rheometer does not allow for easy automation of data analysis and comparison between gels.

This package was designed to automate data analysis from a CSV collected on the AntonPaar rheometer in the Bindra Lab at the University of Washington. Features include:

- Graphing average curves from up to 4 gel types on the same graph from tests including strain sweeps, frequency sweeps, time sweeps, cyclic strain sweeps, and rotational shear step tests.
